# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that repeatedly comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in the desired order.

This algorithm is typically for education purpose and not one you would likely use in production because there are more efficient algorithm than bubble sort.

Bubble sort is an iterative sorting algorithm

## How it works

> Given an array of items, the compares two ajacent items on the array, swaps them if they are out of desired order (i.e., the greater one comes first in the array). Then continue to move forward one index, compare again, swap if needed. Once we've reached the end of the array, if we've swapped anything in the previous pass through, then the array could still be out of order, so we have to pass through again. Once we pass through the whole array with no swaps, then the array is sorted!

At every pass the largest item on this array bubbles to the end of the array followed by the second largest and so on.
